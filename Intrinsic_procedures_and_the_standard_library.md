# Intrinsic procedures and the standard library

## Intrinsic procedures

Fortran has many (generic) intrinsic procedures. They are all listed in table 16.1 in [Fortran 2023 interpretation document](https://j3-fortran.org/doc/year/24/24-007.pdf). Click the links in the table for the information of intrinsic procedures.

## The standard library

Fortran does not have a standard standard library, but Fortran is developing [the Community Driven Standard Library (stdlib)](https://stdlib.fortran-lang.org/).
