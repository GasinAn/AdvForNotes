# Plotting

Fortran has no intrinsic way to do plotting. There are many packages listed on [this page](https://fortran-lang.org/packages/graphics/) of the official website, but I don't like them. Although I write these Notes, I am not a "Fortran party member". In my opinion, we don't need to reinvent a wheel written by Fortran, and we can just use packages written by other programming languages. I wrote [a simple module](https://github.com/GasinAn/fdata2pyplot) for plotting by using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/).
