# Conventions of syntax expressions

The syntax rules of Fortran are expressed with the following conventions, which use conventions in [Fortran 2023 interpretation document](https://j3-fortran.org/doc/year/24/24-007.pdf) for reference.

- Characters are interpreted literally as shown, except where otherwise noted.

- Letters and words enclosed between two grave accents (`` ` ``) represent general syntactic classes for which particular syntactic entities must be substituted in actual statements.

- `:=` introduces a syntactic class definition.

- `||` introduces a syntactic class alternative.

- `{ }` encloses an optional item.
 
- `{ }...` encloses an optionally repeated item which may occur zero or more times.

- `` `xyz-list` := `xyz`{, `xyz`} ... ``.

- `......` stands for a part which I am not willing to talk about temporarily.
