# Enum types and Enumeration types

WARNING: The enum type and the enumeration type in Fortran are DIFFERENT. The enum type is interoperable with C, while the enumeration type is not. See section 7.6 of [Fortran 2023 interpretation document](https://j3-fortran.org/doc/year/24/24-007.pdf) for details.
